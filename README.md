## `P256Verifier` 🐍Vyper Contract

P256 (a.k.a. secp256r1 elliptic curve) signature verification 🐍Vyper contract. These functions can be used to verify a P256 (a.k.a. secp256r1 elliptic curve) signature. The implementation is inspired by dcposch's and nalinbhardwaj's implementation [here](https://github.com/daimo-eth/p256-verifier/blob/master/src/P256Verifier.sol). Also, for more technical details, please refer to [EIP-7212](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212).
